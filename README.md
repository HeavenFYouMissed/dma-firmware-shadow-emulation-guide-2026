# PCIe DMA Firmware Shadow Emulation Guide 2026

**Comprehensive red team research on advanced PCIeLeech firmware customization**  
*(Screamer M.2, EnigmaX1, Artix-7 FPGAs – shadow config space, writemasks, EFUSE DNA locks, timed self-bricks, TLP optimizations & more)*

### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ⚠️
**This repository is for educational and security research purposes ONLY.**  
The techniques documented here are intended to help anticheat developers and blue teams improve detections on real-world DMA vectors like:
- Anomalous PCIe config space behavior
- TLP pattern anomalies
- Donor device signature mismatches
- Writemask inconsistencies

**Do not use for cheating. No responsibility for misuse.** 🔴🔵
